2. Core Features & System Robustness
Core Mechanics: The simulation operates on a real-time energy depletion loop, requiring users to manage the pet's state through interactive commands (Feed, Entertain, Pet) that dynamically adjust energy levels.

Input Validation: Rigorous validation logic ensures system stability. The system rejects non-numeric and negative inputs, enforces logical constraints (IEL ≤ MEL), and utilizes loop-based reprompting for invalid configuration attempts.

Boundary Limits: To prevent integer overflow and ensure gameplay balance, strict upper limits are enforced:
- Maximum Energy (MEL) & Initial Energy (IEL): Capped at 10,000.
- Command Parameters: Capped at 100.
- Energy Depletion Rate (EDR): Capped at 100.

Visual Scalability: The UI employs a ratio-based rendering algorithm for the energy bar. Regardless of the numerical magnitude (up to 10,000), the system normalizes energy values to display a proportional 20-character progress bar, maintaining interface consistency.

3. Additional Features

Sickness Mechanism: Implemented a dynamic status effect where the pet has a probabilistic chance of contracting an illness. This state doubles the energy depletion rate and necessitates user intervention via the 'Cure' command to restore normal gameplay.

Save/Load System: Developed a serialization mechanism that packs game state variables (including energy, level, and most historical statistics) into a multipart integer sequence using bitwise shifting and masking. Data obfuscation is applied via XOR operations to simulate a secure save code.

Sleep Mode: Added a state management feature that pauses the natural energy depletion cycle. While active, standard interaction commands are inhibited to simulate rest, though specific non-intrusive interactions trigger unique feedback without altering game state.

Leveling & Progression: Integrated a dynamic progression mechanic where the difficulty scales linearly with the pet's level (Threshold = 5 + Level*2). Leveling up grants permanent stat boosts (Max Energy +5) and immediate resource bonuses, while higher levels unlock advanced features and milestones.

Dating Simulation: An advanced interaction feature unlocked at Level 2. It utilizes pseudo-random number generation to determine diverse narrative outcomes—ranging from positive energy boosts to humorous "Easter egg" events—adding variety to the gameplay loop.

Game Analytics: A post-session reporting module that aggregates runtime statistics (Time Alive, Total Actions, Sickness Count). It computes a composite score (Final Score = Time Alive + Level*50 + Total Actions*10) and provides qualitative feedback based on the player's performance metrics upon game termination.
